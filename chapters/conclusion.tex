\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this paper has presented significant improvements to the application of Grover's algorithm for uniform random sampling, particularly in the context of software product lines (SPLs).
By optimizing quantum circuits through the removal of redundant operations, the reuse of qubits, and the development of more efficient logic gate structures, the proposed approach reduces both the depth and width of quantum circuits. 
These optimizations enhance the resource efficiency of the algorithm and demonstrate scalability across larger feature models, as evidenced by the evaluation. 
Ultimately, these advancements facilitate the practical application of quantum computing for solving complex problems in software engineering, paving the way for future innovations in SPL management and testing.
